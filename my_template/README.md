# Flutter Template by @leorigna

## Getting Started

Rename all instances of `my_template` to your project name.

You can use the script `rename_template.sh` to do this (it's in the repo root).
Just run:

```bash
chmod +x rename_template.sh
./rename_template.sh com.org.name "My App Name"
```

Remember to update this `README.md` file with your project description.

## FVM

This project uses FVM to manage Flutter versions. You can install it by running:

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
```

Remember to set it up in your IDE.
On Android Studio, you can set it up by going
to `Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter` and setting
the `Flutter SDK path` to the FVM Flutter SDK path.
Eg: /Users/leorigna/Projects/flutter_notebook/my_template/.fvm/flutter_sdk/
